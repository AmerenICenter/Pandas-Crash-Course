Welcome to the iCenter's Pandas Crash Course


The guide will teach you the basics to working with Python Pandas.


The folder contains the following: 
PCC_blank - the blank notebook that you will be working through
charlie.csv - contains a table that you will work with in the Crash Course
partthree.csv - contains a table that you will work with in Part 3 of the Crash Course
PCC_answers - answers to the Crash Course (You can use this if you get stuck)



In order to run the Crash Course, you need to be able to open
and edit Jupyter notebooks. The recommended method is to install
VSCode via Software Center on Ameren devices. Once you install
VSCode be sure to install the Jupyter notebook plugin. 


To complete the Crash Course, open PCC_blank and follow the guide
step-by-step. Pay close attention to examples given before each
challenge. Good luck!
